              <p>Brief: define a game concept and develop a playable prototype of it in a six months period</p>
<!--              <p>Period: two weeks</p>-->

              <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span>The challenge</span> For the Videogame Design and Programming course at Politecnico di Milano, four colleagues and I had to develop a game from scratch. During four months, we set a concept and iterated on the project to refine the gameplay.
              </p>
                <p><span>The solution</span> We tested the final prototype in different environments and with different kinds of people. The game was well perceived and a great number of people enjoyed playing it.</p>

              <h3>Process</h3>
              <p>
                  The <span>design process</span> was iterative, to create payable prototypes as fast as possible to test them as soon as possible. In this way, we found falls early in the development.</p>
              <p>We created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x753lAwoCEdFI_h4ODPUoWeuRNmPHdZk5LgyEHfvR5M/edit?usp=sharing">Game Design Document</a> to document all our decisions and to develop a coherent product.

              <h3>Art direction</h3>
              <p>
                    I was in charge of developing the whole <span>art of the game</span>. The team set the mood of the game together, gathering references and designing a mood board.</p>
              <p>After the idea was defined, I started producing sketches looking for the right feeling. I presented those ideas to my colleagues and once we agreed on one, I began 3D-modelling the asset and then animating it. Finally, I also products 2D assets of the game.

              <h3>Playtests</h3>
              <p>
                       The game was tested three times: once with course colleagues, once at the Global Game Jam hosted at Politecnico di Milano and one at the <a href="http://ngd.unimi.it/event.html">NGD 2019</a>, an event hosted by Università Statale di Milano to the presence of many companies in the gaming industry.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the iterations on the project, we always gathered better feedback from players. Our game was even rated as one of the best at the NGD event.
